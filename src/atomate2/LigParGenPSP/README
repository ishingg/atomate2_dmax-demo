We have updated the original LigParGen source code to include the following features:
(1) Able to store output files in a user-defined directory.
(2) Compatible with the recent versions of Open Babel (v3.1.1), NetworkX (v2.5), and pandas (v1.2.4) libraries.
(3) Generate a data file for the LAMMPS package only.
(4) Delete all temporary files.
